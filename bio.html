                <h1 class="bio-title">Background</h1>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">I was born in the UK and initially lived in the West Midlands. My first computer I got when I was about 9 years old: a <span id="spectrum"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a></span> with a whopping 16KB of onboard ram. There was no hard drive, and games were loaded from cassette tape. If you had the patience you could input your own BASIC programs into it. I would often copy games from the computer magazines that were published at the time. I loved it.<br><br> 

                    At the age of 13 I moved to Vancouver Canada where I attended middle and high school and then graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BA in psychology. On my last day of studies at university I attended my orientation session at Vancouver Film School where I studied screenwriting for film and television. I do small bits of film work here and there whenever I get the chance.<br><br>

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                    In 2001 I moved to Japan to live and work as a teacher of ESL (English as a Second Language). I only planned on staying for maybe 1-2 years total, but it was such an amazing experience that I ended up staying for 7 years. For the first two years I taught at the biggest ESL chain in the country, ‘Nova’, and then landed a job at one of the most prestigious universities in Japan, Waseda University. I taught at Waseda for 5 years.<br><br>
                    
                    Once back in Vancouver, I continued teaching ESL at various schools but the nature of most ESL work in the west being seasonal meant that I needed to keep moving where the work was. Tiring of the instability I went to South Korea for a couple of years and taught there. It was in South Korea where I decided to enroll on a distance learning master’s degree program in creative writing at the university of Lancaster; it has always been a dream of mine to publish a novel. But my MA was more out of pure interest and to keep myself busy. My true career changing decision was to pursue a new line of work in coding.<br><br>
                    
                    While looking into coding bootcamps I found a highly regarded one in Bath, Somerset. I attended <span id="io-academy"><a href="https://io-academy.uk/">iO Academy</a></span> in 2019, and completed the full stack track coding bootcamp there. Unfortunately, right after graduation the pandemic hit. I have been searching for my first developer role ever since.

                <h1 class="bio-title">Fun Stuff</h1>
                <p class="bio-paragraph">I founded and ran <span><a href="http://vancouver-ninjutsu.com/">my own martial arts school</a></span> in Vancouver Canada for three years while at the same time teaching ESL and doing film work. The martial arts school I handed over to my students and is still being run to this day.<br><br>

                    In my free time I continue to write screenplays and novels. I have written about half a dozen screenplays and have recently completed my second novel. None have been published or produced as of yet, partly because almost nobody has ever read any of them. Once life and work gets more stable I will start sending out query letters.<br><br>
                    
                    I have played Dungeons and Dragons, the roleplaying game now produced by Wizards of the Coast, since my high school days. I haven’t played in a long while now but again it’s something I’d like to take up again once life returns to normality. As a part of this hobby I also hand paint miniatures, and have recently picked up a few boxes of Warhammer 40K models. My ‘pile of shame’ keeps growing...<br><br>
                    
                    Hip hop and R&B for life (with some Metalica and other stuff too). Pizza, burgers and steak until they kill me. Normally I’d rather die than eat seafood. But tuna or salmon? Ok maybe.
